Description: Generates n hierarchical clustering hypotheses on subsets of classifiers (usually species in community ecology studies). The n clustering hypotheses are combined to generate a generalized cluster, and computes three metrics of support. 1) The average proportion of elements conforming the group in each of the n clusters (integrity). And 2) the contamination, i.e., the average proportion of elements from other groups that enter a focal group. 3) The probability of existence of the group gives the integrity and contamination in a Bayesian approach.
